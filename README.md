                            Cultural heritage in North Queensland

This project explores the cultural heritage of the pastoral industry in North Queensland.
More information about it can be found at (https://stockroute.org/Cattle/).

The following files comprise

1. Gulflocale.zip -  a related JAVA SWING application built with JAVA 18.
The gulflocale application can be started with the following command  'java -jar gulflocale.jar'
  
3. Deskview.sql - a backup of a POSTGRESQL database of pastoral sites and related features in North Queensland.
The backup was created in pgAdmin4 and it, or the pg_restore command, can be used to restore the database to
your local POSTGRESQL instance. The connection url is in the file longacre.properties this can be edited by you
so that it corresponds to your local settings.
   
4. jimjre.zip - a 'customised' Java runtime for running the gulflocale application for those people who do  not
have JAVA already installed locally.

If you are using the runtime then then command to start the application is
'<your local path>\bin\java7 -jar <your localpath>\gulflocale.jar'
